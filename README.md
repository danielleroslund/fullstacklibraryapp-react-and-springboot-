# Full-stack Library Application

**Project Description**

This project is a full-stack web application for a library system, developed as part of my thesis. The application is built using modern technologies such as *React* and *TypeScript* for the frontend, and *Spring Boot* for the backend. Its purpose is to provide a responsive and interactive user experience where users can search, borrow, review books, and manage their loans. The project also includes security measures and payment handling.

**Features**

-	User Management: Registration, login, and logout via Okta.
-	Book Management: Searching, borrowing, and reviewing books. Administrators can add, modify, and delete books.
-	Loan Management: Handling loan periods and statuses.
-	Review System: Capability for users to submit and view book reviews.
-	Secure Communication: HTTPS implementation for encrypted data transfer.
-	Payment Handling: Integration with Stripe for managing late return fees.
-	Bookshelf: Users can view their borrowing history.


**Technologies:**

**Frontend**

-	React
-	TypeScript
-	Bootstrap
-	CSS

**Backend**

-	Spring Boot
-	JPA (Java Persistence API)
-	SQL database

**Other**

-	JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication
-	HTTPS for secure communication
-	Stripe for payment handling

**Usage:**

-	Register: Create a new user account.
-	Login: Log in with your user account.
-	Search Books: Use the search function to find books.
-	Borrow Books: Borrow available books.
-	Review Books: Leave reviews on books you have read.
-	Manage Loans: View and manage your current loans.
-	Bookshelf: Display history of your past loans.
-	Payment: Pay any late return fees via Stripe.

**Security**

HTTPS ensures that all data transfer is encrypted. Okta and JWT are used for user authentication and resource protection.

**Lessons Learned**

This project has provided me with a deeper understanding of full-stack development and effective frontend-backend integration. I have also learned about security and payment handling in web applications.

**Future Improvements**

-	Testing: Develop more unit tests and integration tests.
-	Functionality and Design: Add more features and enhance the user interface.
-	Documentation and Maintenance: Improve code documentation and structure.

Thank you for reviewing my project!
